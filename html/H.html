<h5><b>The Higgs boson</b></h5>
<p>
The Higgs Boson, also known colloquially as the "God Particle" is the
particle in that proves the existence of the Higgs Field, which is theorized
to be the mechanism by which everything in the universe gets mass. It is the
smallest possible excitation of the Higgs field, and can be though of as the
"mediator" between the Higgs field and the rest of the universe.  CERN has
observed what they believe to be a Higgs Boson with mass of about 125 GeV, and
this observation has been tentatively confirmed, but it is still unclear that
this is the Higgs Boson found in the standard model, or that it is the only
Higgs boson.

<h5><b>History of the Higgs boson</b></h5>
<p>
The Higgs Boson is named for Peter Higgs, who wrote a paper which proposed a
massive, spin-zero boson that would allow for a consistent relativistic field
theory where both massless and massive particles could carry force.  This "Higgs
Boson", if found, would be a huge step towards a unified standard model, and as
such, it became a huge goal for many supercolliders.  On 14 March 2013, the LHC
found what they tentatively believe to be a Higgs Boson, but further research is
still being conducted to confirm and refine the results.
